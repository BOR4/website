This tutorial will introduce you to working with the RISC Zero zkVM in Rust, including:
* How to write RISC Zero zkVM guest code using the `risc0-zkvm-guest` crate
* How to execute the RISC Zero zkVM from a host using the `risc0-zkvm` crate
* How to use the [starter template repository](https://github.com/risc0/risc0-rust-starter) to start a RISC Zero zkVM project starting from some prewritten boilerplate code
* How and when to privately share data between the host and guest
* How and when to publish data from the guest to the public journal
* What artifacts are produced by the RISC Zero zkVM, and how to use those artifacts to attest to the execution of the guest code
